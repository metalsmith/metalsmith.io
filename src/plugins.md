Plugins in the official registry get higher visibility than those only published on Github or NPM, and they must pass a brief quality review. Guidelines for plugins to be accepted in the registry are:
* The package is published in the NPM registry
* The package includes at least 1 test
* The package provides functionality that is different from already registered plugins. Why? &mdash; because we want to encourage collaboration and reduce the amount of confusion for new metalsmith users.

Edit the [plugins.json](https://github.com/metalsmith/metalsmith.io/edit/master/lib/data/plugins.json) file and create a pull request to get your plugin listed.
Plugins need to be added at the correct alphabetical position by `name`: if your plugin's name is "b", it should come right after the plugin named "a".

Add a plugin object to the list with the following properties:

```js
{
  "name": "My plugin",
  "icon": "icon-name",
  "repository": "https://github.com/username/metalsmith-myplugin",
  "description": "Metalsmith plugin for doing something.",
  "npm": "@myscope/metalsmith-myplugin"
},
```
where:

* `name` - should match the NPM package or repository name, but can be in title case & with spaces
* `icon` - one of the [Metalsmith icons](https://jsfiddle.net/kevinvanlierde/csdbnto0/), preferably matching what the plugin does
* `repository` - url to the repository of the plugin, e.g. `https://github.com/username/metalsmith-myplugin`
* `description` - a short description for the plugin, ideally matching `package.json` or Github repository description
* `npm` - optional, to specify a name different than `name`, e.g. for scoped NPM packages (@&lt;myscope&gt;/&lt;metalsmith-myplugin&gt;)
