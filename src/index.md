# Welcome

You want to build a website or blog with a static site generator. Well, here is our elevator pitch. It's as easy as that:

```JavaScript
var Metalsmith  = require('metalsmith');
var collections = require('metalsmith-collections');
var layouts     = require('metalsmith-layouts');
var markdown    = require('metalsmith-markdown');
var permalinks  = require('metalsmith-permalinks');


Metalsmith(__dirname)         // __dirname defined by node.js:
                              // name of current working directory
  .metadata({                 // add any variable you want
                              // use them in layout-files
    sitename: "My Static Site & Blog",
    siteurl: "http://example.com/",
    description: "It's about saying »Hello« to the world.",
    generatorname: "Metalsmith",
    generatorurl: "http://metalsmith.io/"
  })
  .source('./src')            // source directory
  .destination('./build')     // destination directory
  .clean(true)                // clean destination before
  .use(collections({          // group all blog posts by internally
    posts: 'posts/*.md'       // adding key 'collections':'posts'
  }))                         // use `collections.posts` in layouts
  .use(markdown())            // transpile all md into html
  .use(permalinks({           // change URLs to permalink URLs
    relative: false           // put css only in /css
  }))
  .use(layouts({              // wrap layouts around html
    engine: 'handlebars',     // use the layout engine you like
  }))
  .build(function(err) {      // build process
    if (err) throw err;       // error handling is required
  });
```

You want to try yourself, if it is really this easy. Have a go:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/metalsmith/metalsmith.git
$ cd metalsmith/examples/static-site
$ make
```

# Install it

Metalsmith and its plugins can be installed with npm:

```bash
$ npm install metalsmith
```

The package exposes both a [JavaScript API](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith#api), and [CLI](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith#cli) in case you're used to that type of workflow from other static site generators. To see how they're used check out the [examples](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith/tree/master/examples).

# Introduction

Metalsmith is an extremely simple, pluggable static site generator. So let us explain why:

## Why is Metalsmith a *pluggable static site generator*?

The task of a static site generator is to produce static build files that can be deployed to a web server. These files are built from source files. Basically for a static site generator this means:

1. from a source directory read the source files and extract their information
2. manipulate the information
3. write the manipulated information to files into a destination directory

Metalsmith is build on this reasoning. It takes the information from the source files from a source directory and it writes the manipulated information to files into a destination directory. All manipulations, however, it exclusively leaves to plugins.

Manipulations can be anything: translating templates, transpiling code, replacing variables, wrapping layouts around content, grouping files, moving files and so on. This is why we say *»Everything is a Plugin«*. And of course, several manipulations can be applied one after another. Obviously, in this case the sequence matters.


## Why is Metalsmith *extremely simple*?

1. When all manipulations are performed by plugins, the only thing Metalsmith has to do in its core is to provide for an underlying logic of actually how manipulations are dealt with and for a defined interface for the plugins. To achieve this, we only needed around 400 lines of code --- have a [look at the source yourself](https://github.com/metalsmith/metalsmith/blob/master/lib/index.js). We believe this is rather simple.

2. For manipulations Metalsmith uses a very clever, but extremely simple idea. All source files are initially converted into JavaScript objects with the usual **`{property: property value}`** pairs. These **`{property: property value}`** pairs contain information on the original file itself (such as its **`birthtime`** or **`path`**) and on its **`content`**. The JavaScript object for each file is then supplemented with all variables either specified in the front-matter of the file or elsewhere. The manipulations performed by the plugins are now nothing else then modifications applied to the JavaScript objects either by changing the properties or the property values.

3. Breaking down Metalsmith into a core and many plugins has several advantages. It reduces complexity. It gives the user the freedom to use exactly only those plugins he or she needs. Furthermore, it distributes the honor and the burdon of maintaining the Metalsmith core and its plugins onto the Metalsmith community. With this approach we hope to keep the Metalsmith environment pretty up-to-date.

4. Writing plugins itself is also rather simple. The plugin-interface is easy to understand and most plugins are also rather short.

5. Every site needs JavaScript anyway. Just like the popular task runners [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) or [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) Metalsmith is programmed in JavaScript. So, you do not have to rely on a further language such as Ruby, Python or Go. This also helps to keep your workflow simple.

---

# Everything is a Plugin --- A first example

All of the logic in Metalsmith is handled by plugins. You simply chain them together. Here's what the simplest blog looks like. It uses only two plugins, **`markdown()`** and **`layouts()`**...

```JavaScript
Metalsmith(__dirname)          // instantiate Metalsmith in the cwd
  .source('sourcepath')        // specify source directory
  .destination('destpath')     // specify destination directory
  .use(markdown())             // transpile markdown into html
  .use(layouts({               // wrap a handlebars-layout
    engine: 'handlebars'       // around transpiled html-files
  }))    
  .build(function(err) {       // this is the actual build process
    if (err) throw err;    // throwing errors is required
  });
```


... and by the way, if you do not want your destination directory to be cleaned before a new build, just add <b>`.clean(false)`</b>. But what if you want to get fancier by hiding your unfinished drafts and using permalinks? Just add plugins...

```JavaScript
Metalsmith(__dirname)
  .source('sourcepath')      
  .destination('destpath')
  .clean(false)                  // do not clean destination
                                 // directory before new build   
  .use(drafts())                 // only files that are NOT drafts
  .use(markdown())
  .use(permalinks())             // make a permalink output path
  .use(layouts({
    engine: 'handlebars'
  }))
  .build(function(err) {    
    if (err) throw err;
  });
```

...it's as easy as that!

A small comment. Instead of [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) you can also use other templating languages such as [Jade/Pug](http://jade-lang.com/).

# How does it work in more detail?

Metalsmith works in three simple steps:

  1. Read all the files in a source directory and transform them into a JavaScript object of JavaScript objects.
  2. Invoke a series of plugins that manipulate these objects.
  3. According to the information contained in the resulting objects write them as files into a destination directory

Every file in the source directory is transformed into a JavaScript Object. For instance,

`my-file.md:`

```Markdown
---
title: A Catchy Title
draft: false
---

An unfinished article...
```

becomes

```JavaScript
{
  'relative_to_sourcepath/my-file.md': {
    title: 'A Catchy Title',
    draft: false,
    contents: 'An unfinished article...',
    mode: '0664',
    stats: {
      /* keys with information on the file */
    }    
  }
}
```

where the content of the file is always put into the property value of **`contents`**. For illustration purposes only we display the value of **`contents`** as a string. Technically, however, the property value of **`contents`** is realised as a `new Buffer('...')` object, in order to also handle straight binary data well. **`mode`** contains the permission the file has and **`stats`** has more technical information on the file such as `size` or `birthtime`. Furthermore, the file is also parsed for YAML-front-matter information, which will then also be put into the JS Object. Thus, we finally have an JavaScript object of JavaScript objects. This encompassing JavaScript object is usally called **`files`** since it contains all the JavaScript objects that represent the files.

```JavaScript
{
  "relative_to_sourcepath/file1.md": {
    title: 'A Catchy Title',
    draft: false,
    contents: 'An unfinished article...',
    mode: '0664',
    stats: {
      /* keys with information on the file */
    }    
  },
  "relative_to_sourcepath/file2.md": {
    title: 'An Even Better Title',
    draft: false,
    contents: 'One more unfinished article...',
    mode: '0664',
    stats: {
      /* keys with information on the file */
    }    
  }
}
```

The plugins can manipulate the JavaScript objects representing the original files however they want, and writing one is super simple. Here's the code for the **`drafts()`** plugin from above. You can also find the code in the [github repository for `metalsmith-drafts`](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-drafts). The code just runs through the JS object **`files`** and deletes all contained JavaScript objects that have a property value of **`true`** for the property **`draft`**:

```JavaScript
/**
 * Expose `plugin`.
 */
module.exports = plugin;

/**
 * Metalsmith plugin to hide drafts from the output.
 *
 * @return {Function}
 */

function plugin() {
  return function(files, metalsmith, done){
    setImmediate(done);
    Object.keys(files).forEach(function(file){
      var data = files[file];
      if (data.draft) delete files[file];
    });
  };
}
```

Of course plugins can get a lot more complicated too. That's what makes Metalsmith powerful; the plugins can do anything you want and the community has written a large amount of plugins already.

<i><b>Note:</b> The order the plugins are invoked is the order they are in the build script or the metalsmith.json file for cli implementations.  This is important for using a plugin that requires a plugins output to work.</i>

If you are still struggling with the concept we like to recommend you the [**`writemetadata()`**](https://github.com/Waxolunist/metalsmith-writemetadata) plugin. It is a metalsmith plugin that writes the **`{property: property value}`** pairs excerpted from the JavaScript objects representing the files to the filesystem as .json files. You can then view the .json files to find out how files are represented internally in Metalsmith.

```JavaScript
Metalsmith(__dirname)            
  .source('sourcepath')      
  .destination('destpath')   
  .use(markdown())          
  .use(layouts({
    engine: 'handlebars'
  }))
  .use(writemetadata({            // write the JS object
    pattern: ['**/*'],            // for each file into .json
    ignorekeys: ['next', 'previous'],
    bufferencoding: 'utf8'        // also put 'content' into .json
  }))
  .build(function(err) {         
    if (err) throw err;          
  });
```

We believe, that understanding the internal representation of files as JavaScript objects is really key to fully grasp the concept of Metalsmith. To see this, we look at what happens in the second example chain above:

So, within the Markdown chain above after applying **`.use(markdown())`** the initial representation of the `my-file.md` becomes `my-file.html`...

```JavaScript
{
  'relative_to_sourcepath/my-file.html': {
    title: 'A Catchy Title',
    draft: false,
    contents: '<p>An unfinished article...</p>',
    ...
  }
}

```

end after applying **`.use(permalinks())`** it becomes:

```JavaScript
{
  'relative_to_sourcepath/my-file/index.html': {
    title: 'A Catchy Title',
    draft: false,
    contents: '<p>An unfinished article...</p>',
    path: 'myfile',
    ...
  }
}

```

Note, that `permalinks()` is also adding a `path`--property by default.

Assuming somewhere amongst the source files we have defined a very simple standard handlebars layout file...

`layout.html`

{% raw %}
```Handlebars
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>{{title}}</title>
</head>
<body>
  {{{contents}}}
</body>
</html>
```
{% endraw %}

... after applying **`.use(layouts())`** in our Metalsmith chain our JavaScript object becomes:

```JavaScript
{
  'relative_to_sourcepath/my-file/index.html': {
    title: 'A Catchy Title',
    draft: false,
    contents: '<!doctype html><html><head>
               <title>A Catchy Title</title></head><body>
               <p>An unfinished article...</p>
               </body></html>',
    path: 'myfile',
    ...      
  }
}

```

Finally when the **`.build(function(err))`** is performed our JavaScript object is written to `relative_to_destpath/myfile/index.html`. So you see, how the chain works. It's rather straight forward, isn't it?

# Metadata & debugging

For Metalsmith we have stated that everything is a plugin. That is true, but in addition the Metalsmith core also provides for a **`metadata()`** function. You can specify arbitrary **`{property: property value}`** pairs and these information will be globally accessible from each plugin.

```JavaScript
var debug = require('metalsmith-debug');

...

Metalsmith(__dirname)            
  .source('sourcepath')      
  .destination('destpath')   
  .clean(false)
  .metadata({
      author: 'John Doe',
      site: 'http://example.com'
  })
  .use(markdown())
  .use(layouts({
    engine: 'handlebars'
  }))
  .use(debug())             // displays debug info on the console
  .build(function(err) {         
    if (err) throw err;
  });
```

As you have seen in the code above, we have also introduced a plugin named [**`metalsmith-debug`**](https://github.com/mahnunchik/metalsmith-debug). For this plugin to actually show debug information you need to define an environment variable `DEBUG` and set it to:

```bash
$ DEBUG=metalsmith:*
```

The source and destination path, the metadata and all files are then logged to the console.

# Further information

Yes, we know. The documentation can be improved. If you want to help, give us a shout. But in the meantime have a look at the [Awesome Metalsmith list](https://github.com/metalsmith/awesome-metalsmith). There you will find references to a number of excellent tutorials, examples and use cases.

# A Little Secret

We keep referring to Metalsmith as a "static site generator", but it's a lot more than that. Since everything is a plugin, the core library is actually just an abstraction for manipulating a directory of files.

Which means you could just as easily use it to make...

<ul class="Example-list">
{% for example in examples %}
  <li class="Example">
    <h1 class="Example-title">{{ example.name }}</h1>
    <ol class="Example-step-list">
    {% for step in example.steps %}
      <li class="Example-step ss-{{ step.icon }}">{{ step.text }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ol>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

The plugins are all reusable. That PDF generator plugin for eBooks? Use it to generate PDFs for each of your blog posts too!

Check out [the code examples](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith/tree/master/examples) to get an idea for what's possible.

# Writing A Plugin

Writing a plugin is not difficult as you have seen above with the `metalsmith-drafts` plugin. In order to achieve more complicated tasks you will most likely find and can use `npm`-packages. Look at how others have done it. Here is an example using `debug` (which we appreciate if you use it) and `multimatch`:

`metalsmith-myplugin`:

```JavaScript
// we would like you to use debug
var debug = require('debug')('metalsmith-myplugin');
var multimatch = require('multimatch');


// Expose `plugin`.
module.exports = plugin;


function plugin(opts){
  opts.pattern = opts.pattern || [];

  return function (files, metalsmith, done){

    setImmediate(done);
    Object.keys(files).forEach(function(file){
      if(multimatch(file, opts.pattern).length) {
        debug('myplugin working on: %s', file);

        //
        // here would be your code
        //

      }

    });

  };
}
```

---

# Matching

Even though we touched on the topic already, we did not tackle it explicitly. We mentioned that plugins usually run through all files presented to `metalsmith`. This happens in a loop like this:

```JavaScript
Object.keys(files).forEach(function(file){
  //
  // here would be your code
  //
});
```

The question now is, how does for instance a markdown-engine know, which files to transpile? The answer is easy. Per default, `metalsmith-markdown` is checking if `file` has a `.md` or `.markdown` extension. Remember, `file` is a JavaScript object that has its full filename (including its path) as a value.
If the check is not true it jumps over it, otherwise it is passing the file to the engine. After processing it, `metalsmith-markdown` replaces the `.md` extension with an `.html` and the next plugin can now check against the new filename and so on.

A process such as this is called check for pattern matching. Many `metalsmith`-plugins employ such matching. Either they check against internally set requirements or patterns or they offer an explicit option to check against user defined matches, like we have already seen in the `writemetadata`-plugin:

```JavaScript
.use(writemetadata({            // write the JS object
  pattern: ['**/*'],            // for each file into .json
  ignorekeys: ['next', 'previous'],
  bufferencoding: 'utf8'        // also put 'content' into .json
}))
```

Pattern matching is normally based on [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) pattern. Many plugins employ either own functions or rely on [`minimatch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch) or [`multimatch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multimatch).


```JavaScript
var multimatch = require('multimatch');

[...]

  // Checks whether files should be processed
  // length is zero if no matching pattern was found
  if (multimatch(file, opts.pattern).length) {

    // process file

  }
```

# The Community Plugins
The core Metalsmith library doesn't bundle any plugins by default.

Here's a list of plugins that are provided by the awesome Metalsmith community. But mind you, this list is by no means complete, because not every author PRs his or her plugin. So you might want to search for further plugins:

<label class="Plugin-filter">
  <i class="Plugin-filter-icon ss-search"></i>
  <input class="Plugin-filter-input" placeholder="Filter plugins…" />
</label>

<ul class="Plugin-list">
{% for plugin in plugins %}
  <li class="Plugin">
    <a class="Plugin-link" href="{{ plugin.repository }}">
      <h1 class="Plugin-title">{{ plugin.name }}<i class="Plugin-icon ss-{{ plugin.icon }}"></i></h1>
      <i class="Plugin-arrow ss-right"></i>
      <p class="Plugin-description">{{ plugin.description }}</p>
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

If you write your own plugin, submit a pull request to the [metalsmith.io](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith.io/tree/master/src/plugins.json) repository and it will show up here!

# API

Checkout the [project scaffolder](https://github.com/metalsmith/metalsmith/tree/master/examples/project-scaffolder) or [build tool](https://github.com/metalsmith/metalsmith/tree/master/examples/build-tool) examples to see a real example of the Javascript API in use.

### new Metalsmith(dir)

Create a new `Metalsmith` instance for a working `dir`.

### .use(plugin)

Add the given `plugin` function to the middleware stack. Metalsmith uses
[ware](https://github.com/segmentio/ware) to support middleware, so plugins
should follow the same pattern of taking arguments of `(files, metalsmith, callback)`,
modifying the `files` or `metalsmith.metadata()` argument by reference, and then
calling `callback` to trigger the next step.

### .build(fn)

Build with the given settings and a callback having signature `fn(err, files)`.

### .source(path)

Set the relative `path` to the source directory, or get the full one if no `path` is provided. The source directory defaults to `./src`.

### .destination(path)

Set the relative `path` to the destination directory, or get the full one if no `path` is provided. The destination directory defaults to `./build`.

### .concurrency(max)

Set the maximum number of files to open at once when reading or writing.  Defaults to `Infinity`.  To avoid having too many files open at once (`EMFILE` errors), set the concurrency to something lower than `ulimit -n`.

### .clean(boolean)

Set whether to remove the destination directory before writing to it, or get the current setting. Defaults to `true`.

### .frontmatter(boolean)

Set whether to parse YAML frontmatter. Defaults to `true`.

### .ignore(path)

Ignore files/paths from being loaded into Metalsmith.

`path` can be a string, a function, or an array of strings and/or functions.
Strings use the glob syntax from
[minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) to match files and directories
to ignore. Functions are called with the full path to the file as their first
argument, and the `lstat` object returned by Node's `fs.lstat` function as their
second argument, and must return either `true` to ignore the file, or `false` to
keep it.

### .metadata(json)

Get the global metadata. This is useful for plugins that want to set global-level metadata that can be applied to all files.

### .path(paths...)

Resolve any amount of `paths...` relative to the working directory. This is useful for plugins who want to read extra assets from another directory, for example `./layouts`.

### .run(files, fn)

Run all of the middleware functions on a dictionary of `files` and callback with `fn(err, files)`, where `files` is the altered dictionary.


# Metadata API

Add metadata to your files to access these build features. By default, Metalsmith uses a few different metadata fields:

- `contents` - The body content of the file, not including any [YAML frontmatter](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/frontmatter/).
- `mode` - The numeric version of the [file's mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_%28Unix%29).

You can add your own metadata in two ways:

- Using [YAML frontmatter](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/frontmatter/) at the top of any file.
- Enabling [a plugin](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith/blob/master/Readme.md#plugins) that adds metadata programmatically.

### mode

Set the mode of the file. For example,

```bash
$ cat cleanup.sh

--
mode: 0764
--

rm -rf .
```

would be built with mode `-rwxrw-r--`, i.e. user-executable.


# Troubleshooting

## Node Version Requirements
Metalsmith v2.0 and above uses [generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator) which has some considerations for `node.js 0.12.x` and below.

### Using node.js 0.10.x
You have two options:

1. Upgrade to latest stable version of `node.js` (>= `0.12.x` — see "*Using `node.js 0.12.x`*" section below)
2. Use Metalsmith v1.7. Put `"metalsmith": "^1.7.0"` in your `package.json` and `npm install` that version.

### Using node.js 0.12.x
You have three options:

1. Run `node.js` with `--harmony_generators` flag set.
    1. `node --harmony_generators my_script.js`
    2. Using `package.json`: `"scripts": {"start": "node --harmony_generators my_script.js"}`. Run with `npm run`
2. `npm install` [harmonize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/harmonize) and require before Metalsmith is used. e.g. `require("harmonize")(["harmony-generators"]);`
3. Use Metalsmith v1.7. Put `"metalsmith": "^1.7.0"` in your `package.json` and `npm install` that version.
